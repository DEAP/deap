DEAP stands for Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm in Python, it is dedicated to people who
wish to learn how to use evolutionary algorithms and to those who wish to
rediscover evolutionary algorithms. DEAP is the proof that evolutionary 
algorithms do **not** need to be neither complex or complicated.

EAP is part of the DEAP project, that also includes some facilities for the 
automatic distribution and parallelization of tasks over a cluster of computers.
The D part of DEAP, called DTM, is under intense development and currently 
available as an alpha version. DTM currently provides two and a half ways to 
distribute work loads around a clusters or LAN of workstations, based MPI and 
TCP communication managers.
