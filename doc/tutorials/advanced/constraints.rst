Constraint Handling
===================
Evolutionary algorithms are usually unconstrained optimization procedures. In
this tutorial, we present several ways of adding different types of constraints
to your evolutions. This tutorial is based on the paper by Coello Coello
[CoelloCoello2002]_.

Penalty Function
-----------------
Penalty functions are the most basic way of handling constrains for individuals
that cannot be evaluated or are forbidden for problem specific reasons, when
falling in a given region. The penalty function gives a fitness disadvantage to
these individuals based on the amount of constraint violation in the solution.
For example, instead of evaluating an individual violating a constraint, one can
assign a desired value to its fitness. The assigned value can be constant or
increasing (decreasing for maximization) as the distance to a valid solution
increases. The following figure shows the fitness function :math:`g(x)` (in green) and
the penalty function :math:`h(x)` (in red) of a one attribute individual, subject to the
constraint :math:`3 < x < 7`. The continuous line represent the fitness that is
actually assigned to the individual :math:`f(x) = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{cl}g(x) &\mathrm{if}~3 < x < 7\\h(x)&\mathrm{otherwise}\end{array} \right.`.

The figure on the left uses a constant offset :math:`h(x) = \Delta` when a
constraint is not respected. The center plot uses the euclidean distance in
addition to the offset to create a bowl like fitness function :math:`h(x) =
\Delta + \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2}`. Finally, the
right plot uses a quadratic distance function to increase the attraction of the
bowl :math:`h(x) = \Delta + (x-x_0)^2`, where :math:`x_0` is the approximate
center of the valid zone.

In DEAP, a penalty function can be added to any evaluation function using  the
:class:`~deap.tools.DeltaPenalty` decorator provided in the :mod:`~deap.tools`
module. ::

	from math import sin
	from deap import base
	from deap import tools

	def evalFct(individual):
	    """Evaluation function for the individual."""
	    x = individual[0]
	    return (x - 5)**2 * sin(x) * (x/3),

	def feasible(individual):
	    """Feasibility function for the individual. Returns True if feasible False
	    otherwise."""
	    if 3 < individual[0] < 7:
	        return True
	    return False

	def distance(individual):
	    """A distance function to the feasibility region."""
	    return (individual[0] - 5.0)**2

	toolbox = base.Toolbox()
	toolbox.register("evaluate", evalFct)
	toolbox.decorate("evaluate", tools.DeltaPenalty(feasible, 7.0, distance))

The penalty decorator takes 2 mandatory arguments and an optional one. The
first argument is a function returning the validity of an individual according
to user defined constraints. The second argument is a constant value
(:math:`\Delta`) returned when an individual is not valid. The optional argument
is a distance function between an invalid individual and the valid region. This
last argument takes on the default value of 0. The last example shows how the
right plot of the top image was obtained.
