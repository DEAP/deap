Using Multiple Processors
=========================

This section of the tutorial shows all the work that is needed to distribute
operations in DEAP. Distribution relies on serialization of objects which is
usually done by pickling, thus all objects that are distributed (functions and
arguments, e.g. individuals and parameters) must be pickleable. This means
that modifications made to an object on a distant processing unit will not be
made available to the other processing units (including the master one) if it
is not explicitly communicated through function arguments and return values.

Scalable Concurrent Operations in Python (SCOOP)
------------------------------------------------
SCOOP_ is a distributed task module allowing concurrent parallel programming on
various environments, from heterogeneous grids to supercomputers. It has an
interface similar to the :mod:`concurrent.futures` module introduced in Python
3.2. Its two simple functions :func:`~scoop.futures.submit` and
:func:`~scoop.futures.map` allow to distribute computation efficiently and
easily over a grid of computers.

In the :ref:`second part <using-tools>`, a complete algorithm was exposed with
the :func:`toolbox.map` left to the default :func:`map`. In order to
distribute the evaluations, we will replace this map by the one from SCOOP.
::

    from scoop import futures

    toolbox.register("map", futures.map)

Once this line is added, your program absolutely needs to be run from a
:func:`main` function as mentioned in the
`scoop documentation <http://scoop.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html>`_. To
run your program, use scoop as the main module.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m scoop your_program.py

That is it, your program has been run in parallel on all available processors
on your computer.

Multiprocessing Module
----------------------
Using the :mod:`multiprocessing` module is similar to using SCOOP. It can be
done by replacing the appropriate function by the distributed one in the
toolbox.
::

    import multiprocessing

    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()
    toolbox.register("map", pool.map)

    # Continue on with the evolutionary algorithm

.. warning::
   As stated in the :mod:`multiprocessing` guidelines, under Windows, a
   process pool must be protected in a ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` section
   because of the way processes are initialized.

.. note::
   While Python 2.6 is required for the multiprocessing module, the pickling
   of partial function is possible only since Python 2.7 (or 3.1), earlier
   version of Python may throw some strange errors when using partial function
   in the multiprocessing :func:`multiprocessing.Pool.map`. This may be
   avoided by creating local function outside of the toolbox (in Python
   version 2.6).

.. note::
   The pickling of lambda function is not yet available in Python.


.. Parallel Evaluation
.. -------------------
.. The multiprocessing example shows how to use the :mod:`multiprocessing` module
.. in order to enhance the computing power during the evaluations. First the
.. toolbox contains a method named :func:`~deap.map`, this method has the same
.. function as the built-in :func:`map` function. In order to use the
.. multiprocessing module into the built-in :mod:`~deap.algorithms`, the only
.. thing to do is to replace the map operation by a parallel one. Then the
.. difference between the `Multiprocessing One Max Example
.. <https://www.github.com/deap/deap/examples/mpga_onemax.py>`_ and the `Regular One
.. Max Example <https://www.github.com/deap/deap/examples/ga_onemax.py>`_ is the
.. addition of these two lines
.. ::
..
..    # Process Pool of 4 workers
..    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)
..    tools.register("map", pool.map)
..
.. Parallel Variation
.. ------------------
..
.. The parallelization of the variation operators is not directly supported in
.. the algorithms, although it is still possible. What one needs is to create its
.. own algorithm (from one in the algorithm module for example) and change the
.. desired lines in order to use the :meth:`~deap.toolbox.map` method from the
.. toolbox. This may be achieved for example, for the crossover operation from
.. the :func:`~deap.algorithms.eaSimple` algorithm by replacing the crossover part
.. of the algorithms by
.. ::
..
..     parents1 = list()
..     parents2 = list()
..     to_replace = list()
..     for i in range(1, len(offspring), 2):
..         if random.random() < cxpb:
..             parents1.append(offspring[i - 1])
..             parents2.append(offspring[i])
..             to_replace.append(i - 1)
..             to_replace.append(i)
..
..     children = tools.map(tools.mate, (parents1, parents2))
..
..     for i, child in zip(to_replace, children):
..         del child.fitness.values
..         offspring[i] = child
..
.. Since the multiprocessing map does take a single iterable we must
.. bundle/unbundle the parents, respectively by creating a tuple in the
.. :func:`tools.map` function of the preceding code example and the following
.. decorator on the crossover function.
.. ::
..
..     def unbundle(func):
..         def wrapUnbundle(bundled):
..             return func(*bundled)
..         return wrapUnbundle
..
..     tools.decorate("mate", unbundle)
