DEAP documentation
==================

DEAP is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of 
ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent.  It works 
in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanism such as multiprocessing and `SCOOP
<http://scoop.googlecode.com>`_. The following documentation presents the key concepts
and many features to build your own evolutions.
