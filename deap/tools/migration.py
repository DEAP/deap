    """Perform a ring migration between the *populations*. The migration first
    select *k* emigrants from each population using the specified *selection*
    operator and then replace *k* individuals from the associated population
    in the *migarray* by the emigrants. If no *replacement* operator is
    specified, the immigrants will replace the emigrants of the population,
    otherwise, the immigrants will replace the individuals selected by the
    *replacement* operator. The migration array, if provided, shall contain
    each population's index once and only once. If no migration array is
    provided, it defaults to a serial ring migration (1 -- 2 -- ... -- n --
    1). Selection and replacement function are called using the signature
    ``selection(populations[i], k)`` and ``replacement(populations[i], k)``.
    It is important to note that the replacement strategy must select *k*
    **different** individuals. For example, using a traditional tournament for
    replacement strategy will thus give undesirable effects, two individuals
    will most likely try to enter the same slot.

    :param populations: A list of (sub-)populations on which to operate
                        migration.
    :param k: The number of individuals to migrate.
    :param selection: The function to use for selection.
    :param replacement: The function to use to select which individuals will
                        be replaced. If :obj:`None` (default) the individuals
                        that leave the population are directly replaced.
    :param migarray: A list of indices indicating where the individuals from
                     a particular position in the list goes. This defaults
                     to a ring migration.
