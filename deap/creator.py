"""The :mod:`~deap.creator` is a meta-factory allowing to create classes that
will fulfill the needs of your evolutionary algorithms. In effect, new
classes can be built from any imaginable type, from :class:`list` to
:class:`set`, :class:`dict`, :class:`~deap.gp.PrimitiveTree` and more,
providing the possibility to implement genetic algorithms, genetic
programming, evolution strategies, particle swarm optimizers, and many more.

this problem, the method :func:`create` uses the dictionary

so  the new class inherits from the replacement class instead of the
original base class.

`class_replacers` keys are classes to be replaced and the values are the
